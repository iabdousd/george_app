1. Goals page
a. Empty page content text - "Nothing here. Create a Goal by pressing + to get started" - can this be right in the centre of the screen?
b. FAB - UI wise everything is fine.. While selecting the date, the date picker that pops up is stretched vertically can this just be more squarish? and also the dates are not getting reflecting in the UI after selection
c. One further bug I found is that editing a goal by say changing the color creates a new one rather than editing the existing one; i think this is true even if the date is edited

2. Stacks page
a. I think we can remove the word "EDIT" and just keep the pencil icon in the same way as the delete button is kept
b. Add stack button page
i. Default the color to the goal color; - I think that the color for the stacks are being randomly assigned rather than assigning the color selected for the goal

3. Stack todo page
a. After the crumbtrail, I think we can remove the dates on the row below
b. I think we can remove the word "EDIT" and just keep the pencil icon in the same way as the delete button is kept and have both buttons in line with the stack name. This should reduce the space taken at the top a bit

c. Add task page - structure
i. Can we have the task description box expand a bit more vertically; maybe like maxlines 5 or 7 so that it ends at around half the screen
ii. After task description can we have a switch with the text as "Any time" - default is unselected; if selected, the start and end date remain but the time selector goes away
iii for the date and time selector please refer the attachment. Here we can have start and end as two rows and the date and time are separate
    controllers. I think it is a cleaner way to select the date and time separately
iv Below this we can place the recurrence controller. However, for each option, I think we would need to incorporate an end date selection to
    input when to end the recurrence .. Have added two attachments called recurrence weekly and recurrence monthly to give you an idea.. Details
    could be found here: https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/123142/best-practice-for-selecting-a-recurring-event

Note:
a. I was unable to add a task with daily/weekly recurrence. App just stalled. Can you please look into it?
b. Was not able to add a task without recurrence also
c. Can we have a prompt if user tries to put end date before start date
d. the date and time picker that pops up is stretched vertically can this just be more squarish?

Was not able to test the new images under the added task since I am not able to add a task. but the idea is to space them evenly from left to right and the date should be in ddmmm format to take as little space as possible .

I tried to use the attachment but was not able to access the camera and attach a photo - still not able to add a photo

Please let me know if I am missing something while testing.
